Auto Course eval uses chrome as default
Currently supports chrome (v105, v106, v107), edge (v105, v106, v107) on Windows.

### *Disclaimer: *
This is a project on web scraping. The university course evaluation is used to obtain genuine feedback from verified student on course activity each week. This may possibly be used to determine a course lecturer's promotion or raise in pay. Although the autoCourseEval project does not affect a lecturer negatively, it does not also provide the actual events that occured each week. All in all, take the responsibity to fill the forms each week.

## FOR SLOW AUTOMATION CASES: 
1. chrome://settings -> Click Advanced at the bottom -> Check the Use hardware acceleration when available box
2. chrome://flags -> Search for WebGL in the search bar -> Enable / Activate WebGL

There are much better instructions [here](https://superuser.com/questions/836832/how-can-i-enable-webgl-in-my-browser)

**Note**: Run this autoCourseEval in a virtual environment to avoid clash in dependecies.
